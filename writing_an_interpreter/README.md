I will be building an interpreter that takes in the monkey language.

-It will have features such as:
    -Lexer
    -Parser
    -Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
    -Internal Object System
    -Evaluator

-It supports the following data types:
    -Arrays []
    -Hashes {}
    -Strings ""
    -Boolens true
    -Integers 1

-It will have the following features:
    -Variable bindings
    -Arithmetic expressions
    -Built-in functions
    -First-class and higher-order functions
    -Closures
